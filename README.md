# Financial Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
A **learning-focused classification project** that explores how machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent financial transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

The goal was to understand **data preprocessing, class imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation** for fraud detection problems.

---

## What I Did
- Worked with a large financial transaction dataset  
- Cleaned and prepared data for analysis  
- Analyzed class imbalance and applied **SMOTE**  
- Trained baseline and tree-based classification models  
- Evaluated performance using recall, precision, and ROC-AUC  

---

## Model Details
- **Task:** Binary classification (Fraud / Not Fraud)  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Imbalance Handling:** SMOTE  
- **Metrics Used:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

---

## Results (Test Data)
- High recall on fraud cases  
- Strong ROC-AUC score  
- Model performed well on unseen transactions  

---

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## Notes
This project was built for **learning and experimentation** on fraud detection techniques and does not represent a production system.
