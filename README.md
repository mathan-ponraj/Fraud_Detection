# 🛡️ Fraud Detection Model  

## 📜 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction patterns, the model helps in distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent activities, ensuring better security in financial systems.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing transaction patterns and uncovering fraud trends.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical features.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key features that influence fraud detection.  
- **Model Building:** Training and evaluating classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance assessment using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.  

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
